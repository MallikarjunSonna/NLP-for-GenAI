# NLP Lesson 5: Classical NLP Tasks

These tasks are the building blocks of most real-world NLP systems like:
- Chatbots
- Resume parsers
- QA systems
- Translation engines

## ðŸ§± Core Classical NLP Tasks:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Tokenization
**What:** Split a sentence into words or sub-words  
**Example:** "I love NLP." â†’ ["I", "love", "NLP", "."]

**Tools:** nltk.word_tokenize, spaCy, transformers

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
**What:** Assign word types â€” noun, verb, adjective, etc.  
**Example:** "I love NLP" â†’ [("I", PRP), ("love", VBP), ("NLP", NNP)]

**Why it matters:** Helps understand grammar and context.

**Use-cases:** Grammar correction, summarization, sentence parsing

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
**What:** Extract real-world entities â€” names, locations, dates, money, etc.  
**Example:** "Google was founded in California in 1998."  
â†’ [("Google", ORG), ("California", LOC), ("1998", DATE)]

**Use-cases:** Resume parsing, news categorization, info extraction

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Lemmatization & Stemming
- **Stemming:** Chops word to base form (not always accurate)
- **Lemmatization:** Uses grammar + vocab to find root word

**Example:** "running", "runs", "ran" â†’ "run"

**Tools:** NLTK, spaCy

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Chunking (Shallow Parsing)
**What:** Group words into phrases like noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP)  
**Example:** "The tall man" â†’ NP (noun phrase)

**Why:** Useful for extracting info without full sentence parsing

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Dependency Parsing
**What:** Understand how words relate to each other  
**Example:** "John saw Mary with a telescope" â†’ Who used the telescope? (Ambiguity in dependency)

**Use-case:** Needed in deep NLP tasks like translation, summarization
